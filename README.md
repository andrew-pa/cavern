The Endless Hole project aims to build an operating system for fun.
Fun is the most important aspect, because this is a hobby project.
Ideally, it is also educational and enjoyable to some degree.
We make no guarantees about the usability of this software for anything worthwhile.

The name "Endless Hole" is inspired by [hobby tunneling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobby_tunneling), in which people dig tunnels for no reason but the pure enjoyment of digging.
Like digging a tunnel, building an OS is hard work with lots of stressful decisions and tradeoffs, but with the right mindset it can be enjoyable for the committed.
